## Project One For All
### What will we do?
You will receive a simplified clone of the Spotify database. However, it will not be normalized, and your mission will be to normalize the given structure.

### Why is this important?
The normalization process is something that helps to give more credibility to a professional who works with database structures on a daily basis. Normalized structures reduce errors, decrease redundancy, and allow us to ensure greater data integrity.

So, let's go to the project!

### What will we evaluate?
- Your ability to normalize a denormalized database.
- If the queries you develop return exactly the expected number of columns and records, as requested.
- The organization of your code. Always use uppercase for keywords and lowercase for table and column names.

### What should I develop?
You will go through the following challenges, which will work on different skills:

- Analyze two denormalized tables.
- Identify necessary modifications for your tables to be properly in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Normal Forms.
- Create a database from a spreadsheet containing tables and data.
- Create and model tables.
- Queries that involve the main SQL commands seen so far.
