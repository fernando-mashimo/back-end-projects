## Project - All For One
### What will we do?
Woohoo, you have reached the end of the first SQL block, so now you will have the opportunity to put all this knowledge into practice.

Maybe you have already gotten used to our beloved sakila database, but now we have something new. We have chosen a new database for you to work on in a fresh environment for this project.

We hope that, by the end of this project, you will be ready to create solutions that involve the main commands and initial concepts of SQL.

### Why is this important?
The database is one of the most important parts for the operation of software. It is through the database that we have the ability to store, read, modify, and delete data about the different processes that occur in the systems that use them.

We believe that the content covered throughout this block is crucial for you to have a solid foundation to meet the SQL and database knowledge requirements of companies or even your own business.

So, take advantage of this project to consolidate your knowledge using a fresh database.

### What will we evaluate?
- The queries you develop should return exactly the expected number of columns and records, as requested.
- The organization of your code. Always use uppercase for keywords and lowercase for table and column names.

### What should I develop?
You will go through three levels of challenges. Each level will work on different skills:

- Challenges involving SELECT and data creation.
- Challenges on data filtering.
- Challenges on table manipulation.
