# Welcome to the One For All project repository


## Deliverables

<details>
  <summary>üë®‚Äçüíª What should be developed</summary><br />

In the ***One For All*** project, you will use **several** tables to review and consolidate **all** the main concepts seen so far.

You will receive non-normalized spreadsheets that need to be normalized and populated in a database so that you can execute queries to find the requested information.

## Mandatory requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTICE:** You must manually write your query; the automatic query generator in Workbench will not work correctly with the evaluator!

You have received a non-normalized spreadsheet that resembles a simplified version of the Spotify database. The work will consist of two parts:

1. Normalize this spreadsheet, create the tables in your local database, and populate it;

2. Perform the challenges on your normalized and populated database.
