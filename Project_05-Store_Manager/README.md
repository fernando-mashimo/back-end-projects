## Project - Store Manager
### What are we going to do?
You will put into practice the knowledge of architectural patterns you have acquired, using the MSC (Model-Service-Controller) architecture. Additionally, you will exercise your knowledge of REST by creating a fully RESTful API.

### Why is this important?
We have studied extensively about Software Architecture. However, in order to choose and apply the most suitable architectural solution, we must fully understand what we need to develop. If we don't understand the real purpose of the application, it becomes more complicated to apply the best solution.

This exercise is exactly that situation: you are given a set of requirements and based on them, you will decide the best way to model your database and build your application.

Remember to always follow data normalization when modeling your database. Additionally, you should follow the MSC architectural pattern and REST principles to build your backend.

### Specification
### What will we evaluate?
- Code adherence to the specification. Your program should behave as specified in the next section.
- Backend following the MSC architectural pattern.
- Adherence to the REST pattern.

### What should I develop?
This work will be individual.

You will design and develop the API with a MySQL database.

You will develop endpoints to create, display, update, and delete products and sales.
