# Welcome to the Talker Manager project repository


## Deliverables

  👨‍💻 What needs to be developed</summary><br />

  You will build a talker (speaker) registration application where it will be possible to register, view, search, edit, and delete information. For that, you should:

  1. Develop an API for a `CRUD` (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete) of speakers (talkers), and;
  2. Develop some endpoints that will read and write to a file using the `fs` module.
