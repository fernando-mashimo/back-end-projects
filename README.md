# Back-End Projects Repository

Welcome to my `Back-End Projects Repository`! This repository is a collection of various back-end projects that showcase the technologies I have learned so far in the web development course at [Trybe](https://betrybe.com/).

If you're a `tech recruiter` or a `tech enthusiast`, please let me know your thoughts about the projects and my code! I am always willing to learn and improve my coding skills and your feedback will be very much appreciated!

And if you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me at [fernando.mashimo@yahoo.com.br](mailto:fernando.mashimo@yahoo.com.br).

Thank You!

## Technologies Used

- `TypeScript`: A superset of JavaScript that brings static typing and improved tooling to the language, enhancing productivity and code quality.
- `JavaScript`: The ubiquitous programming language that powers the web.
- `MySQL`: A popular and reliable open-source relational database management system.
- `Sequelize` ORM: A powerful Object-Relational Mapping library for Node.js that provides an easy-to-use API for interacting with databases.
- `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)`: A programming paradigm that focuses on encapsulating data and behavior into reusable objects, promoting modularity and code organization.
- `SOLID Principles`: A set of design principles that promote maintainable and extensible code by emphasizing separation of concerns, dependency inversion, and other key practices.
- `MSC Architecture`: A design pattern that separates concerns by dividing an application into three layers: Model, Service, and Controller.
- `Docker`: A containerization platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

## Project Structure

Most of the projects in this repository follow a structure, making it easy to navigate and understand. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

- `src/models/`: The models directory holds the mySQL / Sequelize models representing the data structures and relationships in the database.
- `src/services/`: The services directory contains the business logic and data manipulation code.
- `src/controllers/`: The controllers directory provides an interface between the client and the server, handling requests and responses.
- `src/utils/`: This directory holds utility functions and helper classes used throughout the project.
- `config/`: The config directory contains configuration files for the project, such as database credentials and API keys.
- `tests/`: This directory houses the unit tests for the project.
