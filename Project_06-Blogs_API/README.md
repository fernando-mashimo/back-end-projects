## Project - Blog API
### What are we going to do?
You have probably accessed a blog in your life, right? Now it's time for you to build an API for one! We will apply all the knowledge we have seen in this section to create an API and a database for content production for a blog, following the best practices of software development!

### Why is this important?
This section aims to provide a new perspective on how you program and how you write your tests. It will be an exploratory project that goes beyond just the difficulty of building the API: you will constantly need to think, "Is this the best way to do it?" Let's get to work!

### Specification
### What will we evaluate?
- Code adherence to the specification. Your program should behave as specified in the next section.
- Organization of your code.
- The quality and coverage of your tests.

### What should I develop?
This work will be individual. You will develop and test an API for a Blog, along with a database. We will use the Blogger API as an example. In it, we will have a CRUD of posts with a layer of user authentication.
