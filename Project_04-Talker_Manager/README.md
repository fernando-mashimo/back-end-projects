## Project - Talker Manager
### What will we do?
You will put into practice the knowledge you have acquired in this section about Node.js with Express in building REST APIs.

For this, you will start building a speakers (talkers) application, where you will be able to register, list, search, edit, and delete speakers.

### Why is this important?
The set of operations known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) is the most basic way of manipulating data. Despite that, a significant part of market applications revolves around these four operations. In this project, you will implement these operations using Node.js, Express, and the fs module.

In addition to practicing the knowledge acquired in this section, you will be creating a highly common type of application in the market and experiencing firsthand some of the challenges and peculiarities that these applications can bring.

### What will we evaluate?
- Code adherence to the specification. Your program must behave as specified in the next section.
- Code organization. Using middlewares and routers, your code should be as clean and organized as possible.

### What should I develop?
This work will be individual.

You will create an API for registering and searching talkers.
